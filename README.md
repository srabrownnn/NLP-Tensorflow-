# NLP Text Classification with TensorFlow & Scikit-learn

This project classifies IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using both traditional ML (Logistic Regression) and Deep Learning (TensorFlow). It includes preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and A/B testing.

## Highlights
- Built using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Keras
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Logistic Regression baseline
- Deep Learning model with Embeddings + LSTM
- Hyperparameter tuning using keras-tuner
- A/B testing to compare model performances

## To Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
python ab_test.py
```
